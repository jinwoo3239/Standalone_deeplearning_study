# Code Implementation (Standalone)

**This repository is a personal project to learn deep-learing with pytorch**

The goal is to implement basic MLP, CNN, and GCN with pytorch.  
Codes are refererened in the [Idea Factory KAIST](https://www.youtube.com/@IdeaFactoryKAIST), and all credits are for [Standalone-DeepLearing programs](https://github.com/heartcored98/Standalone-DeepLearning).  
The shared codes were written based on this lecture, and they were slightly modified.
* Final update: 2023. 03. 31.
